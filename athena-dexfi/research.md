All of the **projects** that will be accessible on the **Athena Platform** are researched carefully by **Athena DexFi** Research Team with an **overall rating** derived from the **utility,** **hype,** and **risk** analysis (**scale: percentage**). Each project compromises a high-level summary, highlighting **key features** and **tokenomics insight** crucial to making an **informed investment decision**. Users have access to a wealth of summarised information including the **Whitepaper**, **Website**, **Telegram/Discord,** and the **teamâ€™s background**.

# âš™ Platform

**Athena DexFi** created a platform in **DEFI** that will allow 100% of new users and experienced traders to:

1. **Participate in upcoming presales that have been researched by the team**

(In the future, we will implement investment opportunities not only limited to crypto but in all aspects of businesses.)

2\. A sort of **copy-trading**, even if it would be more correct to call it **portfolio management** by a trader with a history in the **blockchain**. Traders must respect the rules given by the smart contract so they cannot invest in coins that the client did not know before.

3\. Different innovative tools such as **short integration**, **stop-loss**, **stop-market order**, **lending**, and **borrowing** in **DeFi**

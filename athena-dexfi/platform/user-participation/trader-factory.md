Anyone can operate their own trading contract in Athena platform, but first you need to activate your trader account to start creating your own trading contract. Just fill up all the details and activate your trader account.

Next, you can set up your trader contract by clicking on "Select deposit token" and choosing the cryptocurrency that you will use in your trading contract. Please note that the deposit token you select will be the token collected from users who wish to join your trading contract.

You also need to input the following:

1. Min/Max contribution for users to be able to join.
2. Funding Period (No. of days where users can contribute in your trading contract)
3. Maximum Trading Period (No. of days that you can run the trading contract)

Next, you need to select the trading pair that you want to use. Once you have created the contract, you cannot alter it anymore. Therefore, make sure that you carefully choose the trading pair you want to use, as it will be the only pair available for trading within the contract.

Next, you can activate features in the Athena platform for your trading contract, such as limit orders, stop-loss orders, and short orders. While everything remains within the DEFI framework, these features mimic those found in centralized exchanges. Utilizing these features will enhance your ability to manage the trading contract effectively and provide a sense of security to users who join your contract, knowing their investments are better protected.

Finally, before deploying the contract, it is crucial to double-check everything to ensure accuracy and avoid potential issues. Additionally, you have the option to activate extra features, such as social boost, which will generate hype for your trading contract through Athena's social media channels once it is deployed. This increased visibility can attract more users and potential investors to your trading contract. The trader does not pay comissions from his/her profits, they only pay for the creation of contract that they will trade.

**7- Once the sub-account has been created and we have the keys, we have to move part of our funds there. Select transfer assets to send from our main account to the account with the name that we chose directly on derivatives. Select USDT and the amount you would like to use.**

**10- Now choose the trader or bot to copy to Athena DexFi and select it. You will be redirected to the public Telegram channel. In the description of the telegram channel, you will find the name of the bot to contact to connect your Bybit account. You will be asked for the email you linked to Athena DexFi, your Twitter, and your metamask wallet which you used to register on their site. They will only charge you commissions based on the profit generated, based on your ATH level. If you are not registered with Athena, you can still try the bot, but you will have to enter the correct data and retweet the post.**

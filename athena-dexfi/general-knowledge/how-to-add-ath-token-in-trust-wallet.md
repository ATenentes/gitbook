# üìù How to Add ATH token in Trust Wallet

Tokens are Digital [Assets](https://trustwallet.com/assets) created within the application on a particular blockchain. Trust Wallet supports several blockchains where tokens are being issued. Some examples are **ERC20** on the **Ethereum** Network, **BEP20** on **Binance Smart Chain,** and **SPL** tokens on the **Solana** blockchain.

When a token has been successfully sent to the wallet and it does not appear, it can be manually added as a **Custom Token**. For this guide, we will try to add a **BEP20** token to the **Binance Smart Chain**.

## Step 1. Search for the Token <a href="#c21a" id="c21a"></a>

Tap on the toggle sign in the upper right corner of the main Wallet screen. Search for the token, and if the token is not available, you will see a ‚Äú**No Asset Found**‚Äù message with an **Add Custom Token** button.

Tap on **Add Custom Token** button, then make sure that you have selected the correct **Network**. For this guide, we need to select **Smart Chain** on the supported **Network**, since this is a token that resides on the **Binance Smart Chain**.

**ATH Contract address: 0x5597d204118436b5bca397aded5ac6923a26033d**

After pasting or scanning the Contract Address, the other details like the **Name**, **Symbol,** and **Decimals** will be automatically filled up. If not, fill them in manually. Tap on **Save** to continue.

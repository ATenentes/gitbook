**I invested in Athena DexFi, is there any chance I can lose my investment?**

There is no risk-free investment: whoever promises that to you, is probably a scammer. What we can promise you is that we evaluate with great attention all the projects we invest in, as we ourselves are the first to invest our money in the proposed projects. We don't go into projects where the business plan or team is unclear, and we don't invest in any pyramidal scheme. in case we do not have an opportunity with very little risk and a good price we prefer not to invest and wait for better projects. These valuations have, until now, allowed us to have significant results with minimal risks.

**What is the difference between projects and trading contracts?**

In the Athena platform, you can invest in projects early before they go out on the crypto market exchanges, a sort of crowdfunding for projects that have yet to be traded publicly. These tokens are usually sold at the lowest price and during the launch of the project, they begin to gain value. Offered: seed sale, private sale, or presale. While trading contracts are where you can invest in crypto projects by copying an experienced trader of the Athena platform using a smart contract. You don't need to be an experienced trader to use this feature, because it will simply copy the trades of your chosen trader from the platform. All of the trader's performance is recorded and can be viewed by everyone.

**How are the fees of the Athena DexFi calculated?**

Commissions are calculated with a fixed percentage of the invested capital on entry into the projects in a presale or private sale. In trading contracts, on the other hand, commissions are calculated only on the profit generated and not on the capital. In both cases, you can block your ATH tokens in the platform to have a higher level and pay fewer commission fees on all investment opportunities. To get level 0 and participate in investments you don't have to block any ATH tokens. For levels 1-2-3, you have to block 5000 ATH, 25000 ATH, and 50000 ATH respectively. The tokens are blocked for 6 months and upon withdrawal will be charged a fee that varies over time depending on the historical period and its opportunities, Athena will start at launch with a 0% fee and then increase with time. The change of fees is not retroactive so even if the fees increase but you had already locked it in at a lower fee you will always have the same level until the end of the 6 months. The fees calculated are for level 0: 50%, for level 1: 30%, for level 2: 25%, and for level 3: 20%.

**Is KYC required to be able to participate in Athena Investments?**

No KYC check is required on the Athena DexFi website, neither the moment you sign up nor later during your investing activity. the platform is managed by a smart contract which does not allow us to intervene in users' funds even at the request of the authorities. The only thing we can do and put you on our blacklist.
